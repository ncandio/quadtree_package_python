# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the QuadTree package with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the QuadTree package seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to the maintainers with the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Response Time**: We aim to respond to security reports within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
- **Fix**: Critical and high-severity issues will be prioritized for immediate fixing
- **Disclosure**: We follow responsible disclosure practices

## Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

This project implements multiple layers of automated security scanning:

#### 1. Trivy Vulnerability Scanner
- **Filesystem Scanning**: Scans source code and dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Container Scanning**: Scans Docker containers for OS and application vulnerabilities  
- **Secret Detection**: Scans for accidentally committed secrets and API keys
- **Misconfiguration Detection**: Identifies security misconfigurations

#### 2. GitHub Security Features
- **Dependabot**: Automatically monitors dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- **Code Scanning**: Integrates with GitHub's security advisory database
- **Secret Scanning**: Prevents secrets from being committed to the repository

#### 3. CI/CD Security Integration
- Security scans run on every push and pull request
- Results are uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Build fails on critical security issues

### Security Testing

Our security testing includes:

1. **Input Validation Testing**: Ensures proper handling of malformed inputs
2. **Memory Safety Testing**: Tests for buffer overflows and memory leaks
3. **Dependency Security**: Monitors third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities
4. **Configuration Security**: Validates secure configuration practices

### Secure Development Practices

1. **Code Review**: All changes require security-focused code review
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions and access rights
3. **Input Sanitization**: All external inputs are validated and sanitized
4. **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
5. **Memory Management**: Uses modern C++ smart pointers for automatic memory management

## Security Architecture

### Memory Safety
- Uses C++17 `std::unique_ptr` for automatic memory management
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles
- Exception-safe code with proper cleanup

### Input Validation
- Boundary checking for spatial coordinates
- Type validation for all public API methods
- Graceful handling of edge cases and invalid inputs

### API Security
- Immutable data structures where possible
- Clear separation between public and private interfaces
- Comprehensive error reporting without information disclosure

## Vulnerability Management Process

1. **Detection**: Automated scans and manual security testing
2. **Assessment**: Severity evaluation using CVSS scoring
3. **Prioritization**: Critical > High > Medium > Low severity
4. **Remediation**: Develop and test security fixes
5. **Deployment**: Release security patches promptly
6. **Communication**: Notify users of security updates

## Security Configuration

### Recommended Deployment Settings

When using the QuadTree package in production:

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate spatial coordinates before insertion
2. **Resource Limits**: Implement appropriate limits on tree depth and node count
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for all QuadTree operations
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual usage patterns

### Example Secure Usage

```python
import quadtree

def safe_quadtree_insert(qt, x, y, data):
    """Safely insert a point with validation"""
    try:
        # Validate inputs
        if not isinstance(x, (int, float)) or not isinstance(y, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError("Coordinates must be numeric")
        
        if abs(x) > 1e6 or abs(y) > 1e6:
            raise ValueError("Coordinates exceed reasonable bounds")
        
        # Insert with error handling
        qt.insert(x, y, data)
        return True
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error securely (don't expose internal details)
        print(f"Insert failed: coordinates validation error")
        return False
```

## Security Updates

Security updates are delivered through:

1. **Patch Releases**: Critical security fixes
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Detailed vulnerability information
3. **Release Notes**: Security-relevant changes documented
4. **Automated Notifications**: Via GitHub's security alert system

## Compliance

This package follows security best practices aligned with:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks
- **CWE/SANS Top 25**: Most dangerous software errors  
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Security and privacy controls
- **Supply Chain Security**: SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts)

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns, please reach out through:
- GitHub Issues (for non-sensitive topics only)
- Security reporting email (for vulnerabilities)
- Project maintainers
