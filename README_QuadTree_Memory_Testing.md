# QuadTree Memory Stress Testing

## Overview
The QuadTree memory stress test (`test_quadtree_memory_stress.py`) is a comprehensive testing suite designed to assess the memory management quality and detect potential memory leaks in the QuadTree C++17 implementation.

## Purpose
This test goes beyond basic functionality to evaluate:
- **Memory leak detection** during intensive operations
- **Memory usage efficiency** with large datasets
- **Resource cleanup** verification
- **Implementation robustness** under stress conditions
- **Thread safety** during concurrent operations

## Test Categories

### 1. Memory Leak Detection
- **Cyclic Operations**: Repeated creation/destruction cycles to detect cumulative leaks
- **Progressive Monitoring**: Memory tracking during long-running operations
- **Cleanup Verification**: Ensures proper resource deallocation

### 2. Stress Testing
- **Massive Insertions**: Up to 100,000 points with memory-per-point analysis
- **Large Object Storage**: Tests with data objects from 1KB to 1MB
- **Query Intensive**: Thousands of rectangular queries under load
- **Collision Detection Stress**: Heavy collision detection with clustered data

### 3. Edge Cases
- **Boundary Conditions**: Extreme coordinate ranges and precision limits
- **Memory Fragmentation**: Patterns that could cause memory fragmentation
- **Concurrent Access**: Multi-threaded operations testing thread safety

### 4. Quality Metrics
- Memory usage efficiency (KB per point)
- Resource cleanup percentage
- Performance under stress
- Data integrity maintenance

## Running the Test

```bash
# Basic execution
python Lib/test/test_quadtree_memory_stress.py

# With enhanced monitoring (requires psutil)
pip install psutil
python Lib/test/test_quadtree_memory_stress.py
```

## Output

The test provides:
1. **Console Output**: Real-time progress and immediate results
2. **JSON Report**: Detailed metrics saved as `quadtree_memory_stress_report_[timestamp].json`

### Report Contents
- Test results summary (pass/fail status)
- Memory snapshots with timestamps
- Leak candidate identification
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory usage patterns

## Interpreting Results

### Memory Leak Indicators
- **Progressive Growth**: Memory that doesn't return to baseline after operations
- **Poor Cleanup Efficiency**: Less than 80% memory release after deletion
- **High Memory Per Point**: More than 5KB per stored point

### Quality Assessment
- **Excellent**: All tests pass, no leaks detected
- **Good**: High success rate with minimal memory concerns  
- **Fair**: Some memory issues detected, investigation recommended
- **Poor**: Significant memory management problems

## Integration

This test complements the existing QuadTree test suite:
- `test_quadtree_simple.py` - Basic functionality
- `test_quadtree_api_complete.py` - Comprehensive API testing
- `test_quadtree_memory_stress.py` - Memory and stress testing
- `test_quadtree_production.py` - Production scenario testing

## Dependencies

**Required**: Python 3.7+, QuadTree module compiled
**Optional**: `psutil` (enhanced memory monitoring), `resource` module (Unix systems)

The test will run with reduced monitoring if optional dependencies are unavailable.
